# bST-Reflector-ERC20
Our Work in Progress v1 Reflector Token


This token is an abstraction layer for our fork of 3rdWeb.  It is a base token for NFTs of choice with perks planned for using it as your chosen token to work with NFTs, and has the pleasant side effect of being a Holder token that pays a taxation fee split to all owners proportionately to their portion of the token ownership %!

In short, its a Reflector Token.  These have 2 layers build into them, one is for tax fees and the other is for the normal token data flow.  It uses this to reward ecosystem token holders without having to put their risks into so called "Staking" protocols and risk regulatory entanglements.  This token self-manages and is worthy of a treasury token as long as it is never hacked of value and our devs will be sure to keep your funds secure and offer Bug Bounty programs for the reflector base tokens as time goes on and the community and market caps and TLVs grow.
